      "The sequence defined by the term `2n + 1` generates a series of odd numbers, specifically, an arithmetic sequence. Let's explore how to represent the sum of the first 'n' terms of this sequence using the Sigma notation and derive a closed-form expression for the sum.\n",

      "**Understanding the Sequence**\n",

      "\n",
      "* If n starts from 0: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,...\n",

      "\n",
      "Since `2n + 1` generates an arithmetic sequence, we can employ the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find a closed-form expression (direct formula without summation) for the sum. The general formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:\n",

This constant difference is called the common difference, often denoted as 'd'. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using two different formulas, depending on the information you have.\\n\\n**Formulas for the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence**\\n\\n### When the nth term is not known:\\n\\nThe sum of the first 'n' terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the following formula:\\n\\nS<sub>n</sub> = n/2 [2a + (n - 1)d]\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n*   S<sub>n</sub> is the sum of the first 'n' terms\\n*   'n' is the number of terms\\n*   'a' (or a<sub>1</sub>) is the first term of the sequence\\n*   'd' is the common difference\\n\\n### When the nth term is known:\\n\\nAlternatively, if the nth term (the last term in the series you're summing) is known, the sum of the first 'n' terms can be calculated using the following formula:\\n\\nS<sub>n</sub> = n/2 (a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>n</sub>)\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n*   S<sub>n</sub> is the sum of the first 'n' terms\\n*   'n' is the number of terms\\n*   a<sub>1</sub> is the first term\\n*   a<sub>n</sub> is the nth term (the last term in the series you're summing)\\n\\n**Explanation of Terms and How to Apply the Formulas**\\n\\n*   **n (Number of terms):** This is the number of terms of the sequence you are adding together. For example, the sum of the first 5 terms means n = 5.\\n*   **a (First term):** This is the first number in the arithmetic sequence.\\n*   **d (Common difference):** This is the constant value that is added to each term to get the next term in the sequence. To find 'd', subtract any term from the term that follows it (e.g., a<sub>2</sub> - a<sub>1</sub>).\\n*   **a<sub>n</sub> (nth term):** This is the last term in the portion of the sequence you are summing.\\n\\n**Example**\\n\\nLet's say you want to find the sum of the first 20 terms of the arithmetic sequence: 1, 5, 9, 13,...\\n\\n1.  **Identify the values:**\\n    *   n = 20 (we want the sum of the first 20 terms)\\n    *   a = 1 (the first term is 1)\\n    *   d = 4 (the common difference is 5 - 1 = 4)\\n2.  **Apply the formula (since we don't know the 20th term directly):**\\n    *   S<sub>n</sub> = n/2 [2a + (n - 1)d]\\n    *   S<sub>20</sub> = 20/2 [2(1) + (20 - 1)4]\\n    *   S<sub>20</sub> = 10 [2 + 19(4)]\\n    *   S<sub>20</sub> = 10 [2 + 76]\\n    *   S<sub>20</sub> = 10 \\\\* 78\\n    *   S<sub>20</sub> = 780\\n\\nTherefore, the sum of the arithmetic sequence 1, 5, 9, 13,... up to 20 terms is 780.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 805, 'prompt_tokens': 943, 'total_tokens': 1748, 'completion_time': 1.073333333, 'prompt_time': 0.059531839, 'queue_time': 0.054422581, 'total_time': 1.132865172}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c523237e5d', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--47210f0d-aa47-4fd4-960a-9d7750aa0242-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 943, 'output_tokens': 805, 'total_tokens': 1748}\n"
