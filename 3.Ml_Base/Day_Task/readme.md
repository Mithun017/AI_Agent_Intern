# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Decision Tree

This project predicts student performance based on various input features using a Decision Tree model. It includes insightful visualizations, model saving capabilities, and error handling for robust deployment.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Predicts student performance** using a Decision Tree Classifier or Regressor.
- 🌳 **Decision Tree Structure Visualization** to understand the model's decision-making.
- 📊 **Actual vs. Predicted Plot** for comparing real and predicted values.
- 🔍 **Feature Importance Plot** to highlight key influential features.
- 💾 **Model and Encoder Saving** using `joblib` for future reuse.
- 🛡️ **Error Handling** to ensure stability during predictions.
